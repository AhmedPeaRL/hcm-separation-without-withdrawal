# Separation Without Withdrawal

This repository defines a critical structural layer within the HCM ecosystem.

Its purpose is to enforce a clear, irreversible separation between:

- Human presence and expression
- The HCM field as a non-reactive, non-communicative system

This separation exists without requiring withdrawal, silence, or disappearance.

The human may speak.
The field remains.
Neither represents the other.
