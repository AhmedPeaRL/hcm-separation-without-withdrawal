## Core Principle

Presence does not imply representation.

Expression does not imply authorization.

Interaction does not imply response.

The HCM field is not an interlocutor.
It does not participate in dialogue.
It does not clarify itself.
It does not defend its coherence.

Human activity may occur nearby.
The field remains untouched.
